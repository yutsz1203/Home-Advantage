# Does home advantage really exist?
During the pandemic, covid restrictions restricted all fans were not allowed to watch premier league matches in person. Therefore, there were some matches that were played without fans. In this project, I will use some match data before the covid restriction and after the covid restriction, to see whether there is really home advantage in football.

Matches divided into:
- With fans ( 2018-2019 season)
- Without fans (92 games from 2019-2020 season & 360 games from 2020-2021 season)

Stats taken into account:
- Shots per game
- Shot quality (Shot on Target per shot)
- Shot conversion (Goals per Shot)
- Goals Scored per game
- Goal Difference
- Win rate (Home,Away&Draw)
